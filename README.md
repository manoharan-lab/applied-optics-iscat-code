# Code for generative modeling and Bayesian analysis of data for interferometric scattering microscopy

See the following publication for additional details:

de Wit, X. M., Paine, A. W., Martin, C., Goldfain, A. M., Garmann, R. F., & Manoharan, V. N. (2023). Precise characterization of nanometer-scale systems using interferometric scattering microscopy and Bayesian analysis. _Applied Optics_.

Please consult the main notebook `main.ipynb` for details and instructions on the code.

All data required for the main notebook as well the auxiliary .py scripts are available for download in the [Harvard Dataverse repository](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/N7GJYC). Please download all files and place them in the `data/` directory.

The `environment.yml` file can be used to set up a python environment to run the analysis code.  To install this environment with the `conda` package manager, use
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
